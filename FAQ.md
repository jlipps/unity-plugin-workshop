# Workshop FAQ

Q: Do I need to already know how to use Appium before this workshop?
A: Yes. This workshop assumes you are already familiar with mobile testing using Appium. Specifically, we will be using Android in this workshop. See the prerequisites document for more info.

Q: Does the Unity plugin work for more than Android? Is the knowledge learned in this workshop transferable?
A: Yes. The skills learned in the workshop will apply to any Unity platform: iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, etc...

Q: Which programming language will the examples be developed in?
A: JavaScript, specifically WebDriverIO. You are free to follow along in the programming language of your choice. The only code we will be writing is WebDriver/Appium code, so if you are more familiar with another Appium client, you can simply translate on the fly into whatever makes sense for you.

Q: Which game(s) will we test?
A: We'll use one of Unity's templates, for a 2d platformer. We won't spend much time modifying the game itself as our goal is to focus on how to use the Appium plugin, not how to develop games.

Q: Will the test code we write in the workshop be available afterward?
A: Yes, everything is already available in the workshop repo

Q: It sounds like we are using AltUnity Tester. Do we need the paid version?
A: No. I developed the Appium plugin to work with the free version. Presumably it also works with the paid version since the server component is the same!

Q: I already know how to use AltUnity Tester on its own; why should I learn about the Appium plugin?
A: The model of using an AltUnity client on its own is fine, but you're mixing two separate APIs. The Appium plugin allows you to stay completely within the Appium world. The Appium plugin also allows you to connect to AltUnity from any language with an Appium client (not just C# or Python).
